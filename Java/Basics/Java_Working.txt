How Java Works?

JDK --> JRE --> JVM

Java Development Kit;
Java Runtime Enviroment (Tools);

Source Code(.java) -> Compiler -> Byte Code(.class) -> Java Virtual Machine -> Native Code

Native Code is Machine Code.
Source to ByteCode = Compilation.
ByteCode to Native Code = Execution.

Java is a Portable Language
